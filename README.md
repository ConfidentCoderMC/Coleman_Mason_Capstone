# The PyGuide
This web development project was designed to educate people about Python programming and guide them through core aspects of the language. In addition, the site provides links to external resources, such as other guides and online code editors.

The About page describes the Python's origins and uses.

The Tutorials page provides the PyGuides.

The Resources page leads visitors to other Python resources and is where the user survey can be found.
The user survey collects user information such as name and email address. Also, the survey features questions that ask users to about their experience on the PyGuide.
